models:
  - name: int_clearinghouse__station_status
    description: |
      TMDD Status data from PeMS Clearinghouse. This seems to be the main source of detector
      ID to station ID mapping.
    columns:
      - name: META_DATE
        description: The date of the XML metadata file.
      - name: STATION_ID
        description: The station ID.
      - name: DETECTOR_ID
        description: |
          The detector ID. In general, there can be several detectors for a single
          station, corresponding to different lanes of traffic.
      - name: DETECTOR_NAME
        description: The name of the detector.
      - name: DETECTOR_STATUS
        description: |
          Detector status as reported by the XML file. Probably not useful when determining
          *actual* status of the detector.
      - name: LAST_UPDATE_TIME
        description: The last updated time. This seems to be empty for the whole dataset.
      - name: LANE_NUMBER
        description: |
          The lane number for the detector. This seems to be reported as
          1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc for each successive lane, rather than counting up
          from one.
      - name: _VALID_FROM
        description: |
          The date that this metadata became valid. Should be the same as `META_DATE`.
          Finding the right metadata for a date should involve a check with
          `_VALID_FROM <= date < _VALID_TO`.
      - name: _VALID_TO
        description: |
          The date that this metadata became *invalid*.
          Finding the right metadata for a date should involve a check with
          `_VALID_FROM <= date < _VALID_TO`.
  - name: int_clearinghouse__detector_agg_five_minutes
    description: |
      Raw 30 second sample data aggregated to the 5 minute level.
      Volume values are summed, occupancy is averaged.
    columns:
      - name: ID
        description: The station ID.
      - name: SAMPLE_DATE
        description: The date on which the sample was taken.
      - name: SAMPLE_TIMESTAMP
        description: The timestamp of the start for the 5 minute aggregated samples.
      - name: district
        description: The district in which the VDS is located. Values are 1-12.
      - name: sample_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume (flow)
          and occupancy values contain any non-null value.
      - name: lane
        description: |
          Lane associated with a route and station from raw data.
      - name: volume_sum
        description: Number of vehicle that passed over the detector during the sample period for the lane.
      - name: zero_vol_ct
        description: Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume (flow) value equals 0.
      - name: occupancy_avg
        description: Occupancy of the lane during the sample period expressed as a decimal number between 0 and 1.
      - name: zero_occ_ct
        description: Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's occupancy value equals 0.
      - name: zero_vol_pos_occ_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume
          (flow) value equals 0 but occupancy is greater than 0.
      - name: zero_occ_pos_vol_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's occupancy value
          equals 0 but volume (flow) is greater than 0.
      - name: high_volume_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of volume (flow) values in a lane that exceeded the high
          value threshold detector diagnostic parameter for a station.
      - name: high_occupancy_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of occupancy values in a lane that exceeded the high value
          threshold detector diagnostic parameter for a station.
      - name: speed_weighted
        description: |
          Speed in the lane as measured by the detector in miles/hour.
          Weighted by count of samples in each period.
