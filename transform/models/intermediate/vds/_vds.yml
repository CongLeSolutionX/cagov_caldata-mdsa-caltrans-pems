  - name: int_vds__controller_config
    description: |
      Configuration metadata for VDS controllers. There may be multiple
      stations hooked up to a single controller. For example, the same
      controller might have a station for the mainline as well as a station
      for an onramp.

      This table is a slowly-changing-dimension-2, meaning that it has multiple
      different versions of the metadata for each controller, with `_valid_from`
      and `_valid_to` datetime columns indicating when the version is correct.
    columns:
      - name: controller_id
        description: The unique ID of the controller.
      - name: controller_type
        description: The type of the controller.
      - name: district
        description: The Caltrans district for the controller.

  - name: int_vds__station_config
    description: |
      Metadata for a single VDS station. Multiple stations may be connected to
      a single controller, and multiple detectors may be connected to a single station.

      This table is a slowly-changing-dimension-2, meaning that it has multiple
      different versions of the metadata for each controller, with `_valid_from`
      and `_valid_to` datetime columns indicating when the version is correct.

        description: The timestamp from which this row is valid.
      - name: _valid_to
        description: The timestamp to which this row is valid. If it is still valid, this is `null`.
  - name: int_vds__detector_config
    description: |
      Metadata for a single loop detector. This is the device that actually records
      flow, occupancy, and speed, and is typically installed in a single lane.
      Multiple detectors across a set of lanes constitute a station.

      Unlike the equivalent configuration models for controller and station,
      this metadata model is further joined with metadata for each detector's
      station. This adds some further denormalization to the table, but is a
      practical response to so many downstream metrics relying on station metadata.

      This table is a slowly-changing-dimension-2, meaning that it has multiple
      different versions of the metadata for each controller, with `_valid_from`
      and `_valid_to` datetime columns indicating when the version is correct.
    columns:
      - name: detector_id
        description: The unique ID of the detector.
      - name: station_id
        description: The ID of the station to which the detector is connected
