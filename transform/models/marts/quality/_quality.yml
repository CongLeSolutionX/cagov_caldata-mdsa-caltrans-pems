  - name: quality__row_count_summary
    description: |
      This model counts the number of detectors across multiple models on a daily basis
      to ensure that the detector count is consistent between all of the models. The models
      where detector counts are being evaluated are:
      - int_diagnostics__detector_status model
      - int_clearinghouse__detector_agg_five_minutes_with_missing_rows
      - int_imputation__detector_imputed_agg_five_minutes
      - int_performance__detector_metrics_agg_five_minutes
      The daily detector counts for these models should match. As an additional aggregation
      the number of good and bad detectors in calculated in this model as well to monitor
      for any changes that should be investigated. The number of detectors and their health
      should not vary drastically so this model can help identify anamolies that should be
      investigated.
