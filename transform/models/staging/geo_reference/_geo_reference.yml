      This polygon feature class represents the California county boundaries. Based on TIGER/Line 2010 county
      files, the Caltrans districts and California county name abbreviation were added to this layer for
      Caltrans internal GIS application. [Data

      The District feature class is a polygon coverage representing the California Department of Transportation
      (Caltrans) district boundaries. There are 12 Caltrans Districts in California. Caltrans also has Regions
      as higher level management areas. The names of Caltrans Regions are included in the layer attribute table.

      The District boundary definitions are primarily based on the California county boundaries. The Board of
      Equalization (BOE) County and City Boundary web service is the authoritative source of County boundaries
      and this was used to digitize the district boundaries based on the data from March 2023. This data is
      solely for informational purposes. District 9 has been operating independent of the Central Region since
      November 1, 2015. Kern County remains the only split county in the state, between Districts 6 and 9
      respectively. The BOE data was also used to create the district boundary layers along the coastline.

      StateHighways are state highways based upon the Caltrans Linear Referencing System. Each record in this
      layer represents a highway segment where the county, route, postmile prefix, and postmile suffix are the
      same. Each segment has a begin and end postmile. This geometry is based upon the extraction from TSN on 10 October 2022.

      Each segment is coded with the district, county, route, postmile prefix (if any), begin postmile, end postmile, and
      postmile suffix (if any). One additional field - AlignCode - should be understood by the user for effective use of this
      data set (refer to the Entity and Attribute Information section of this metadata).

      AlignCode indicates if the state highway segment is on a Right alignment, Left alignment, Right side of an independent
      alignment or Left side of an independent alignment. Where TSN (Transportation System Network - the source database)
      considers most state highways to have just a centerline, the underlying LRS (Linear Referencing System) linework that
      these segments are based upon has a line for each direction.

      On undivided highways the right and left lines are identical. On divided highways the right and left are separated,
      but TSN treats the segment as a single centerline. In the last case where highways are not only divided but also have
      different lengths (where the right and left carriageway diverge around physical obstacles or are separated onto
      different one-way streets) the underlying linework has dual carriageways, and TSN treats the segment as an
      "independent alignment".  In some cases (especially for small-scale mapping), it may be appropriate to display
      linework for just one alignment (e.g. Right alignment), and only for the other side where TSN indicates independent
      right and left alignments. In other cases (e.g. large-scale mapping), it may be appropriate to display postmiles for
      both alignments, regardless of how TSN treats the segment.

      The bOdometer and eOdometer fields represent the actual distance in miles from the start of the highway to the begin
      and end of each highway section.  This is in contrast to the begin and end postmile values, which no longer represent
      these values as each highway is realigned (and made longer or shorter) over time. [Data
